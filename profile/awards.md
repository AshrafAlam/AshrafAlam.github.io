# Microsoft Most Valuable Professional

First introduced in 1993, the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional award has very strict criteria and is conferred annually to the best and brightest technical community leaders. To be placed into consideration for the MVP Award, a nomination referral must be first submitted by either a Microsoft Full Time Employee (FTE) or Microsoft MVP, who has a good understanding of how the candidate displayed passion, community spirit , leadership and most importantly demonstrated positive impact and influence within the technical community. Once a recommendation is submitted, a candidate's profile is reviewed by the judges. The specific award criteria vary from year to year due to changes in available products and technologies, but Microsoft emphasizes the overall importance of leadership when it comes to sharing knowledge and advice, including the ability to "lead others to result in a much bigger impact ... than what you could contribute as an individual."
